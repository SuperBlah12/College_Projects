<p>The great preacher, CH Spurgeon, was exceedingly fond of cigars. One vigilant congregation member accused him of turning his cigars into an idol, a false god. The quick-witted Spurgeon replied, "Madam, I burn my idols every day."</p>
<p>The end of the first game ends up by directing you to rip up cards. Not just any old card, but your character card. My character card, which I'd painstakingly named Athena. But as it turns out, gods can die after all. Other cards had been ripped up in the course if this game, but this one was the hardest. One player flat-out refused to destroy his card, and left it at the bottom of his chest for next week. As you can see, when I tried to tear up the card, I could only get halfway. Actually burning the card was excruciating.</p>
<p>Turns out, destroying what you love is hard. I love this game already.</p>
