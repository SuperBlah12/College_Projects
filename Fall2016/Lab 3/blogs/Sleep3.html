<h2>Bad Things Happen When You Don't Get Enough Sleep</h2>

<p>Whatever your personal minimum is, you don't want to undercut it on a regular basis. Check out what the National Sleep Foundation's expert panel concluded for young adults (age 18-25):</p>

<blockquote>The Panel does not advocate sacrificing sleep duration for school, work, or social responsibilities because short sleep duration is associated with increased fatigue, decreased psychomotor performance, accidents, poor physical and psychological health, and low academic performance.</blockquote>

<p>And similarly for adults from 26 to 64 years:</p>

<blockquote>Sleep deprivation's adverse effect on multitasking performance, weight regulation, job safety, mental health, sugar regulation, blood pressure, and cardiovascular health was noted, particularly with nighttime sleep deprivation during the workweek.</blockquote>

<p>The effects of sleep deprivation go beyond mere sleepiness. Besides the effects mentioned above, you may lack the judgment to make ethical decisions, or be more likely to gain weight over time. Missing out on sleep can make you more likely to die of a heart attack.</p>

<p>Longer term, work schedules that routinely disrupt employees' sleep are on the IARC's list of "probable" causes of cancer. That's the same category as red meat, hot beverages, and the pesticide glyphosate. To be clear, we don't know for sure that shift work is a carcinogen, but there are enough links between sleep deprivation and poor health that the idea is not far-fetched.</p>
