<h2>No, Naps Probably Can't Replace Sleep</h2>

<p>So far, we've been assuming that you get all or most of your sleep in one big chunk at night. Long-time Lifehacker readers might remember that a few years ago, polyphasic sleep was all the rage: just take six tiny naps per day, and you can ditch the whole idea of getting a good night's sleep. If this worked, it would be the ultimate time saver.</p>

<p>Great thinkers throughout history supposedly slept very little or on erratic schedules-Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Jefferson are classic examples. But those stories don't really hold up to inspection, and conveniently these geniuses are all dead and can't be interviewed.</p>

<p>So, we asked Dr. Winter about whether naps can really replace sleep. He wasn't impressed:</p>

<blockquote>Polyphasic sleep proponents have nothing beyond anecdotal experiences that never hold up when rigorously tested...I would confidently say that sleep science would fall almost uniformly in the corner of saying this life hack is bogus.</blockquote>

<p>To be clear, a comfortably long middle-of-the-day nap is still fine, and if that's part of your routine you are welcome to continue. Young children need naps as part of their daily sleep, too. But if you're taking short naps just to get through the day, you probably didn't get enough sleep in the first place.</p>

<p>The idea of polyphasic sleep as a productivity tool was inspired by studies like this one published in Work And Stress that examined how crews in sailing races were able to stay alert around the clock. The sailors didn't sleep at night because that's when collisions and trouble were more likely to happen, so they were left with no choice but to take short naps throughout the day. The most productive sailors took naps ranging from 20 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>Naps can help give you back some of your alertness when you are sleep deprived, and with enough naps the sailors were able to stay functional for days on end. The more sleep they got, though, the better they raced.</p>

<p>Nap-centric sleep schedules don't seem to be sustainable. The bloggers who popularized the idea of polyphasic sleep typically gave up this extreme form after a few months, going back to a routine with a block of nighttime sleep and, for some, a nap or two during the day. (I looked, but could not find anybody who had kept up round-the-clock naps for years.)</p>

<p>So, like it or not, sleeping at night is here to stay. Naps can help you survive if you don't get enough sleep at night, but for a healthy mind and body you'll have to make sure to hit the sack for at least six hours a night-and for most of us, probably seven or more.</p>
