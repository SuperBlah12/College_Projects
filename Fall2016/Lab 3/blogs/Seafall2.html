<h2>A Lesson In Object Permanence</h2>

<p>The first ever "legacy" game, Risk Legacy, had this sticker sealing the box: "what is done can never be undone". It is the most dramatic piece of board-game packaging I've encountered, and it proclaims boldly: here is something new. Risk Legacy is the greatest version of Risk you've never played, and a high watermark in Hasbro's extensive catalogue.</p>
<p>Designed by Rob Daviau, it is a fusion of avant-garde performance art masquerading as a respectable, mass-market board game (alongside Monopoly, Risk is one of most recognisable board game titles in the world). Nothing like this had ever been done before.</p>

<p>Normal board games are like The Simpsons. No matter what craziness ensues in an episode, the next episode starts the same way with the family on the TV couch, and there are never any lasting changes. Bart is trapped in pre-adolescent rebellion, and Homer will never age enough to lose another hair. The central conceit of legacy games is that the game doesn't reset. Not precisely. Now we're watching The Wire, or Arrested Development, or Archer, and changes stay changed. Games accumulate history. Games accumulate scars. Like the North, The Game remembers.</p>
<p>The reality is that Seafall, and legacy games in general, are the beautiful lovechild of board games and Dungeons and Dragons. Playing a board game is now a season-long campaign, and both board and players will have scars aplenty by the end. What is done can never be undone, and the "legacy format" genie can never be put back into the bottle. Pandemic Legacy followed, lodging itself firmly at the top of the BoardGameGeek charts. Seafall is the third legacy game, and the first wholly designed by Rob Daviau.</p>
