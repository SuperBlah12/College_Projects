<h2>Sailing Towards The New World</h2>
<br><img src="media/SeafallBoat.jpg" width="700">
<p>Seafall's a 4X game, channeling the spirit of Civilization or, more appropriately, Sid Meier's Colonization. We set our soundtrack accordingly, and prepared ourselves to follow the footsteps of Messrs Columbus and Cook, de Gama and Cortez. For there is a sea to be sailed, islands to explore, goods to trade, and natives to mistreat.</p>
<p>Doing all of the above gains you glory, and glory wins you the game. Not unlike real life, glory is fickle and fleeting, because glory also resets each game. However in due course, the game will reveal how lasting glory can be gained and kept, and the most glorious player will be ultimately victorious at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>Seafall itself is sumptuous. There are miniature ships (one powerful warship, one fast clipper), custom dice, the usual plethora of cardboard, and pre-assembled treasure chests. Each player gets a chest to store their loot, but there are other treasure chests. Sealed ones, and multiple warnings to not open them. Intriguing.</p>
<p>The mechanics are complex enough to present multiple strategies (should I play the short term game, raid the island villages, and build lasting enmity, or play a longer, gentler game of trading and building?). Future games promise possession of islands (there's a place to write my name, but no instruction to just yet), and growing warfare between players. But the first game starts as a gentle race to explore.</p>

<p>Every time a new island was explored, we open the Captain's Booke. The permanent marker comes out to mark off the areas we've explored, and like a Choose Your Own Adventure book, you are presented with an option: steal from the natives or spend time honouring their ways? Let your sailors rest, or encourage them to gather wood quickly? In so doing, we permanently unlock spaces on the board: spice farms, markets and harbours and other intriguing mysteries.</p>
<p>One person at the table has been playing Civ 6 hard - he told me he clocked up 22 hours over the weekend. By the end he proclaimed, satisfied: "this scratches my Civ urges."</p>

<p>That's the game - the prologue game, at least. But the real game, the real joy is the name game. You get to name your leader, your port, your province, and your ships. When you hire advisors, they are yours to name. When you reach the target glory points, you get to name an island. Naming things in perpetuity is a daunting prospect. Should your names be whimsical or referential, geeky or mythical or serious? And the glory of our evolving game is that now it is ours.</p>
<p>Your copy of Seafall will be different to mine. Only here, with these cards, can Captain Fluffy hire Francis Drake the explorer. Only here can Lara (Croft) guide you to buried treasure, and Dupre (from Ultima) lead your military raids, or risk your lot with that madman, Ham Sandwich.</p>
<p>I own a lot of games - a lot of games - but this game is now truly mine.</p>
